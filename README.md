# webpack-starter

A quick little setup for how I like to create web applications.

# install

-   `git clone https://github.com/josfeenstra/webpack-starter`
-   `rm webpack-starter/.git`, you probably want a fresh repo
-   `mv webpack-starter my-project`, you probably want to use a different name
-   `npm i` to install everything
-   Turn on prettier plugin (vscode specific)
-   `npm run watch` or `npm run build`
-   Host `public/` using 'live server' (or anything else)
-   Start hacking!
