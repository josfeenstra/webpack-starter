# webpack-starter

A quick little setup for how I like to create web applications. 

# install

0. `git clone https://github.com/josfeenstra/webpack-starter`
1. `rm webpack-starter/.git`, you probably want a fresh repo
1. `mv webpack-starter my-project`, you probably want to use a different name
1. `npm i` to install everything
1. Turn on prettier plugin (vscode specific)
1. `npm run watch` or `npm run build`
1. Host `public/` using 'live server' (or anything else)
1. Start hacking!
